# Gender Detection using Deep Learning

This project implements a **Gender Detection** system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow and OpenCV for image preprocessing. The model classifies whether a person in an image is **male** or **female**.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to classify images of faces into two categories: **male** or **female**. The system leverages deep learning techniques, particularly a CNN, to analyze and learn from a dataset of facial images. We use OpenCV for face detection and image preprocessing.

- **Classes**: 
  - Male (Label: 0)
  - Female (Label: 1)
  
You can replace this dataset with your own dataset as needed.

## Model Architecture
We designed a CNN model to classify the gender of individuals in the images. Hereâ€™s an overview of the architecture:
- **Input**: Preprocessed facial image
- **Layers**: 
  1. Convolutional Layers with ReLU activation
  2. MaxPooling Layers
  3. Fully Connected Layers (Dense)
  4. Dropout Layer (to prevent overfitting)
- **Output**: Softmax activation for two classes: Male or Female.

The model was trained using TensorFlow and Keras.
